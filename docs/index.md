# Documentation of ArchLinux installation

This document shall document the installation of ArchLinux on a PC for the first time.
Decisions for packages/settings and Links to the original (top!) ArchLinux installation are documented.

The settings files are contained in this repository.

## Motivation

Here a few points why I want to install an Arch system on my machine:

* I want to have a Linux system which I fully understand what's happening under the hood.
* I also want to have a small, efficient and high performant system on relatively old hardware.
